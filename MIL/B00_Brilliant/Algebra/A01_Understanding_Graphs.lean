/- # Solving Linear Equations

This theorem demonstrates how to solve a linear equation of the form ax + b = 0,
where a and b are real numbers and a is not zero.

The theorem states that for any real numbers a and b, where a is not zero, there
exists a real number x such that ax + b = 0.

The proof uses the following steps:
1. Proposes the solution x = -b/a
2. Uses field_simp to simplify the equation with the non-zero condition on `a` value
3. Uses ring tactic to complete algebraic simplification

/- This theorem demonstrates the algebraic identity (x + 1)(x - 1) = x^2 - 1.
   It uses the `ring` tactic, which is a powerful tool for solving algebraic
   equations in Lean.

   The `ring` tactic automatically applies the rules of commutative rings to
   simplify and prove algebraic equalities. In this case, it expands the left
   side of the equation (x + 1)(x - 1) and simplifies it to x^2 - 1, which
   is exactly the right side of the equation.

   This proof is concise and elegant, showcasing the power of automated
   theorem proving in Lean for algebraic identities. -/

/-- This theorem proves that there exists a real number x that satisfies the quadratic
equation x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0. The proof uses the following steps:

1. `use 2`: This step suggests that x = 2 is a solution to the equation. It
   introduces 2 as a witness for the existential quantifier.

2. `norm_num`: This tactic normalizes numerical expressions and performs
   arithmetic calculations. In this case, it evaluates the left-hand side of the
   equation when x = 2:

   2^2 - 5*2 + 6
   = 4 - 10 + 6
   = 0

   This confirms that x = 2 indeed satisfies the equation.

By providing a specific value (x = 2) that satisfies the equation and verifying
it computationally, the theorem proves the existence of a solution to the
quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0. --/

Theorem: For any real numbers `a` and `b`, if `a > 0`, then `a * b^2 ≥ 0`.

Explanation:
- `a * b^2` is the product of `a` and `b` squared.
- `b^2` is always non-negative (since squaring any real number results in a non-negative value).
- If `a` is positive, `a * b^2` will be non-negative.

The `nlinarith` tactic:
- Solves inequalities with non-linear arithmetic.
- `nli` means "non-linear".
- `narith` means "arithmetics".

Examples using `nlinarith`:

Example 1:
```lean
example (x y : ℝ) (hx : x > 1) (hy : y < 2) : x * y + 1 > 0 := by
  nlinarith
```
Explanation:
- Given `x > 1` and `y < 2`.
- Goal: `x * y + 1 > 0`.
- `nlinarith` handles this automatically.
:
Example 2:
```lean
example (p q : ℝ) (hp : p ≥ 0) (hq : q ≥ 0) : p + q^3 ≥ 0 := by
  nlinarith
```
Explanation:
- Given `p ≥ 0` and `q ≥ 0`.
- Goal: `p + q^3 ≥ 0`.
- `nlinarith` solves this using the non-negativity of `p` and `q^3`.
