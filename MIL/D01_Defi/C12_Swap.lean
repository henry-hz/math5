-- This theorem takes in the current reserves of token A and B, the swap input amount of token A,
-- and the swap fee as parameters. It then:
--
-- 1. Asserts the reserves and input amount are non-zero
-- 2. Asserts the fee numerator is less than denominator
-- 3. Calculates the input amount minus the swap fee
-- 4. Calculates the new reserve amounts after the swap
-- 5. Asserts token B reserve is still greater than 0 after swap
-- 6. Asserts the constant product formula still holds after swap
-- 7. Returns the amount of token B that will be sent to the user
